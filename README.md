I'm a Second Year Commputer Science student at Loughborough University. I am an avid learner and enjoy the complex challenges of software development. I enjoy playing sports, especially rugby. I grew up in Lyon, France, and speak fluent French!

<summary><h3>What am I looking to gain from completing a placement year?</h3></summary>
As an avid learner, I believe a placement year would allow me develop new skills in the computer science industry. I hope to be challenged and enhance my technical skills, problem solving abilities and coding proficiency during my placement year and would love the opportunity to learn new programming languages, tools and technologies that are relevant to the industry. I am looking to gain practical experience and apply the theoretical knowledge I have gained in my coursework to the projects and problems I face by providing high quality work during my placement year. Additionally, a placement year will allow me to have a firsthand look at the inner workings of the computer science industry, helping me to better understand my career preferences and goals. A placement would provide clarity about which areas of computer science interest me the most (and align with my long-term career aspirations).

<summary><h3>What about software development as a career interests me?</h3></summary>
A career in software development appeals to me for multiple reasons. Software and it’s applications can be found everywhere, so I can imagine such a variety of software projects would entail creating diverse software systems across different sectors that are all equally as challenging and fascinating. A software engineer could find themselves working on a bespoke system involving cutting-edge medical equipment, and later create a web service for a charity, and each project would entail unique problems and solutions. In software development there is no “correct” way of approaching a given problem, meaning programmers tend to think outside the box in order to solve them. Most careers involve some degree of problem-solving but few careers require the tenacity and creativity of software developers. Programming is particularly interesting to me as I find it to be very rewarding. The process of conceiving a piece of software from scratch and obtaining a tangible product that responds to a given need is extremely satisfying and the prospect of doing so throughout my career appeals to me.

<summary><h3>What recent developments in software excite me?</h3></summary>
When the Apple Vision Pro was launched in June of this year, I was quite sceptical as to how the device would perform and whether it would live up to the promises Apple had made about it. Spatial computing seems to be the next logical interface after mobile and desktop, blurring the lines between digital objects and the real world. Apple ran the risk of making another Virtual Reality headset without pushing the boundaries of what the technology could potentially achieve, but what the Vision Pro represents is a major leap in Augmented Reality technology, offering advanced features such as high resolution displays, precise motion tracking, immersive spatial audio and an improved gesture recognition which elevate the user experience. As a default, the product comes with a web browser and a range of multimedia apps that you might expect from a desktop or a mobile device, but what excites me is the range of potential applications this headset opens up for the future. The headset could offer diverse applications in domains such as gaming, eductaion, productivity, design, healthcare and more. For instance it could enable immersive gaming experiences, interactive educational content, advanced visualisation for healthcare professionals or innovative ways of accessing information and communication. Apple's commitment to providing robust developer tools and APIs could lead to the creation of a wide range of AR applications specifically tailored for the headset, and various platforms are already working on producing optimised content for the device, including the likes of Disney. I believe AR is in it’s early stages of development, and will most likely take multiple years to settle, in the same way the mobile phone did in the early 2000’s, however it is an exciting frontier with many unexplored possibilities for creativity that I am eager to see flourish.
