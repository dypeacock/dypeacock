 <summary><h3>What am I looking to gain from completing a placement year?</h3></summary>
 As an avid learner, I believe a placement year would allow me develop new skills in the computer science industry. I hope to be challenged and enhance my technical skills, problem solving abilities and coding proficiency during my placement year and would love the opportunity to learn new programming languages, tools and technologies that are relevant to the industry.
I am looking to gain practical experience and apply the theoretical knowledge I have gained in my coursework to the projects and problems I face by providing high quality work during my placement year.
Additionally, a placement year will allow me to have a firsthand look at the inner workings of the computer science industry, helping me to better understand my career preferences and goals. A placement would provide clarity about which areas of computer science interest me the most (and align with my long-term career aspirations).
